# Data
1. [list](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists): You will be able to use indexing/slicing to work with a subset of items from a list.
2. [dict](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries): You will be able to work with (key, value) pairs.
3. [numpy](https://numpy.org): You will be able to work with N-dimensional arrays (e.g., initialization, indexing/slicing, views, math, aggregation, logical masks, matrix multiplication). You will appreciate the power of N-D arrays for many types of data, and the speed and clarity of numpy vs. pure python.
4. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org): You will be able to work with dataframes (i.e., tables; indexing/slicing, to/from numpy, groupby, plot). You will appreciate that pandas dataframes far exceed the ability of common programs like Excel to manage large tabular datasets.
5. [xarray](https://xarray.dev): You will appreciate the usefulness of N-D arrays with labeled dimensions.
6. [zarr](https://zarr.dev): You will be able to store data in a self-describing hierarchical format either locally or in the cloud.
7. [dask](https://www.dask.org): You will be able to work with big data too large to entirely fit on your personal computer.
