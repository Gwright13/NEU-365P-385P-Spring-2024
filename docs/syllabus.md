# üöß Syllabus
NEU 365P/385P - Spring 2024 - Programming and Data Analysis for Modern Neuroscience

‚ö†Ô∏è *The syllabus is subject to change as the course progresses depending on my judgement.* This is because I modify my course every year to make it that much better for you. That said, the current syllabus is at least a reasonable approximation of what the final course will look like.

Python intro
---
1. <details><summary>Jan 16 T - Course intro and python intro</summary>
  
     - You will get a brief overview of the course.
     - You will be able to use `conda` to manage python environments.
     - You will be able to use `conda` and `pip` to manage python packages within each environment.
     - You will be able to run python code in a Jupyter notebook.
     - You will understand some basic python code:
       - Variables
       - Types
       - Basic operations
       - Logical comparisons
       - Comments

   </details>
2. <details><summary>Jan 18 R - Python basics</summary>
  
     - You will understand some basic python code:
       - `if` code blocks
       - Nested code blocks
       - `list` and index/slice
       - `dict` (key,value) pairs
       - `for` and `while` loops
       - Functions (optional named and default arguments)
       - Assignment vs mutation

   </details>
3. <details><summary>Jan 23 T - Classes and modules</summary>
  
     - You will understand how to compartmentalize python code beyond simple functions:
       - `class` code blocks
       - Class `__init__` method
       - Class instance (`self`) vs class template
       - Class inheritance
       - Modules

   </details>

Working with data
---
4. <details><summary>Jan 25 R - Numpy N-dimensional arrays and matplotlib</summary>
  
     - You will appreciate that many types of data can be represented as N-dimensional arrays.
     - You will understand how to work with `numpy` N-dimensional arrays.
       - Array initialization (e.g., `zeros`, `ones`, `random`) and `shape`
       - Element-wise array math
       - Index and slice
       - Logical masks
       - Reductions (e.g., `min`, `max`, `mean`, `var`)
       - Broadcasting
     - You will appreciate that `numpy` can be *much much* faster than raw python.
     - You will appreciate that without `numpy` we would not use python for most data analysis.
     - You will be able to visualize data with simple plots using `matplotlib`.
