# üöß Syllabus
NEU 365P/385P - Spring 2024 - Programming and Data Analysis for Modern Neuroscience

‚ö†Ô∏è *The syllabus is subject to change as the course progresses depending on my judgement.* This is because I modify my course every year to make it that much better for you. That said, the current syllabus is at least a reasonable approximation of what the final course will look like.
